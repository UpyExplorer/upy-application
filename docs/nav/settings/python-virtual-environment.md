# Python Virtual Environment

## Summary

A virtual environment is a way for you to keep copies of your Python interpreter in a local folder. This way you can install new Python packages in specific folders and remove them easily by just deleting them.

## Environment Creation

- Create a new virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
```
- Activating the virtual environment:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```
